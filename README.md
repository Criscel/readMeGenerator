# readMeGenerator
This ReadMe generator that generates a ReadMe.md file for user just by entering couple of information regarding their projects. 

Each questions are ordered based on the structure of the ReadMe file that will be generated. 

## Installation
I initially installed npm using terminal. After npm install, I started filling the index.js file with the questionaries for the datas that need to be transfered to the generateMarkdown.js file and this is where the writeToFile function is - for creating the new file. Then I finilised the generateMarkdown.js for the output structure of the new ReadMe file with the badge.
